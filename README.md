### About

I'm a Product Developer Advocate in the [AWS container service team](https://aws.amazon.com/containers/), a CNCF [Cloud Native Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/), and try to help you to be successful with containerized workloads. This includes but is not limited to: container security & compliance such as [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/), Kubernetes, GitOps, service meshes, observability, and Arm-based systems like our [Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) offering.

I mainly use Go, Rust, and shell scripts in my day to day work, but also have done Python, C/C++, Java, and PHP.
