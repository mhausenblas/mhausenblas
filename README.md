### About

I work in the [AWS open source observability service team](https://aws.amazon.com/products/management-and-governance/use-cases/monitoring-and-observability/) as the Product Manager for AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) and also serve as a [Cloud Native Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/) at CNCF. In my day-to-day work I do POCs and write tools using mainly Go, Rust, and shell scripts, but have also used Python, C/C++, Java, and PHP over the past 25+ years.

To reach me, please use:

* For AWS-related topics, via e-mail: [hausenbl@amazon.com](mailto:hausenbl@amazon.com).
* For all other topics, such as open source or personal messages, via e-mail: [mh9@aws-cloud.dev](mailto:mh9@aws-cloud.dev).
* I'm usually hanging out on CNCF Slack and also my Twitter DMs are open (IOW you don't need to follow me to message me there).
