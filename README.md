I'm work as an Open Source Product Developer Advocate in an [AWS service team](https://aws.amazon.com/containers/)  and serve as an [Cloud Native Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/) at CNCF. My goal is to help you be successful with containerized workloads and learn about your pain points. I'm focusing on observability (incl. but not limited to [OpenTelemetry](https://aws-otel.github.io/), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [BPF](https://ebpf.io/)) as well as service meshes (especially [SMI](https://smi-spec.io/)). 

I'm also interested & proficient in Kubernetes, GitOps, security/compliance as well as the [UX of AWS services](https://ux.aws-cloud.dev/), and last but not least in the advance of applications on Arm-based systems like on our [Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) offering.

Occasionally, I do live streams either via my [personal site](https://live.mh9.dev/) or via [Containers From The Couch](https://containersfromthecouch.com/). If you're more into books, my two current ones are [Programming Kubernetes](https://programming-kubernetes.info/) and [Kubernetes Security](https://kubernetes-security.info/).

In my day to day work I mainly use Go, Rust, and shell scripts, but also have done Python, C/C++, Java, and PHP.
