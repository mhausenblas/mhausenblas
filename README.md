### About

I'm a Solution Engineering Lead at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/products/management-and-governance/use-cases/monitoring-and-observability/) and serve as a [Cloud Native Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/) at CNCF, focusing on open source observability (Prometheus/OpenMetrics, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, OpenSearch, Fluent Bit) as well as service meshes, especially in my role as an [SMI](https://smi-spec.io/) maintainer.

I'm also interested and proficient in Kubernetes, GitOps, security & compliance as well as in the advance of applications on Arm-based systems such as on our [Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) offerings.

Also, check out the [Hacking Kubernetes](https://h4ck1ng-kubernets.info) book I co-authored as well as [Learning Modern Linux](https://modern-linux.info/), which is currently available in Early Release at O’Reilly.

In my day to day work I mainly use Go, Rust, and shell scripts, but also have done Python, C/C++, Java, and PHP.
