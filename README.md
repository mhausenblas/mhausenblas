### About

I'm a Principal Open Source Technologist at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/containers/) and serve as a [Cloud Native Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/) at CNCF, focusing on observability (such as OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Fluent Bit) as well as service meshes, especially in my role as an [SMI](https://smi-spec.io/) maintainer.

I'm also interested and proficient in Kubernetes, GitOps, security/compliance as well as in the advance of applications on Arm-based systems such as on our [Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) offerings.

In my day to day work I mainly use Go, Rust, and shell scripts, but also have done Python, C/C++, Java, and PHP.
