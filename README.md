### About

I'm a Solution Engineering Lead & the OpenTelemetry PM in the [AWS open source observability service team](https://aws.amazon.com/products/management-and-governance/use-cases/monitoring-and-observability/) and serve as a [Cloud Native Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/) at CNCF. In my day-to-day work I do POCs and write tools using mainly Go, Rust, and shell scripts, but have also used Python, C/C++, Java, and PHP over the past 25+ years.
