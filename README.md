### About

I'm a Product Developer Advocate in the AWS container service team, a CNCF [Cloud Native Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/), and I try to help folks to be successful with containerized workloads. This includes, but is not limited to: container security & compliance (for example [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)), Kubernetes, GitOps, service meshes, observability, and Arm-based systems.

I mainly use Go, Rust, and shell scripts in my day to day work, but also have done Python, C/C++, Java, and PHP.
