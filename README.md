I'm an Open Source Product Developer Advocate in the [AWS Elastic Containers](https://aws.amazon.com/containers/) service team and serve as an [Cloud Native Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/) at CNCF. My goal is to help you be successful with containerized workloads and learn about pain points. This includes but is not limited to: OSS observability (Prometheus, [BPF](https://ebpf.io/), etc.), container security & compliance for example with [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/), Kubernetes, GitOps, service meshes, API/SDK/CLI [user experience](https://ux.aws-cloud.dev/) of our offerings, as well as interested in the advance of applications on Arm-based systems like on our [Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) offering.

I mainly use Go, Rust, and shell scripts in my day to day work, but also have done Python, C/C++, Java, and PHP.
