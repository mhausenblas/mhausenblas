### About

I work in the [AWS open source observability service team](https://aws.amazon.com/products/management-and-governance/use-cases/monitoring-and-observability/) as the product lead for our [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT)](https://aws.amazon.com/otel/) and try to help customers to successfully introduce observability, based on an [Return on Investment (RoI)-Driven](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13402) strategy.

From 2018 to 2022 I served as a [Cloud Native Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/) at CNCF, focusing on Kubernetes, Prometheus, and OpenTelemetry. Time allowing, I do experiments and write tools using Go, Rust, and shell scripts, and over the past 25+ years I have also used Python, C/C++, Java, and PHP in various open source and proprietary projects and products.
