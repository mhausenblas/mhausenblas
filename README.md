### About

I work in the [AWS open source observability](https://aws.amazon.com/products/management-and-governance/use-cases/monitoring-and-observability/) service team with a portfolio including but not limited to [OpenTelemetry](https://aws.amazon.com/otel/), open-source [observability solutions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/AMG_solutions.html), and [Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus collector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-collector.html). I help customers to successfully introduce open-source observability, based on a [Return on Investment (RoI)-Driven](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13402) strategy.

From 2018 to 2022 I served as a [Cloud Native Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/) at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), focusing on Kubernetes, Prometheus, and OpenTelemetry. Time allowing, I do experiments and write tools using Go, Rust, and shell scripts, and over the past 25+ years I have also used Python, C/C++, Java, and PHP in various open-source and proprietary projects and products.

Before AWS, I worked at Red Hat in the OpenShift business unit, at Mesosphere on DC/OS and Kubernetes, at MapR (now part of HPE) on Apache Hadoop, HBase, and Drill, and prior to that I spent more than 11 years in applied research, in the field of symbolic AI.
